WHOOP AI Coach Demo - Product Requirements Document & Implementation Backlog

# Introduction/Overview
Feature Name: WHOOP AI Coach Demo - Conversational Health Assistant

Problem Statement: 83% of WHOOP users report decision paralysis when interpreting their health data. Users receive rich biometric insights but struggle to translate this data into actionable daily decisions, leading to frustration and underutilization of their health tracking investment.

Solution: A conversational AI interface that transforms complex WHOOP biometric data into personalized, actionable guidance through natural language interactions, specifically designed for busy executives who work out 4x/week but lack time to interpret their health metrics.

# Goals
## Primary Goals:

Create a functional demo showcasing AI-driven health guidance using synthetic WHOOP user data
Integrate OpenAI API with a conversational interface for real-time health insights
Deploy a publicly accessible demo that demonstrates the value proposition
Build a clean, maintainable codebase suitable for portfolio presentation
Learning Objectives:

Master system prompt engineering for domain-specific AI applications
Implement LLM API integration with contextual user data
Create realistic synthetic health data that mimics WHOOP metrics
Deploy a full-stack AI application to production

# User Stories

## Primary User Persona: "Executive Alex"
Age: 35, Tech Executive
Fitness: Works out 4x/week, moderate intensity
Pain Points: Limited time to analyze health data, wants quick actionable insights
Goals: Optimize performance, improve sleep, maintain consistency
Core User Stories

### US1: Daily Guidance

As Executive Alex,
I want to ask "Should I work out today?" and get a personalized recommendation based on my current recovery metrics,
So that I can make informed decisions without spending time analyzing complex dashboards.

### US2: Symptom Analysis

As Executive Alex,
I want to ask "Why am I tired today?" and understand the connection between my recent metrics and current state,
So that I can identify patterns and adjust my behavior accordingly.

### US3: Sleep Optimization

As Executive Alex,
I want to ask "How can I improve my sleep?" and receive personalized recommendations based on my sleep patterns,
So that I can implement specific changes rather than generic advice.

### US4: Trend Understanding

As Executive Alex,
I want to explore my historical data through conversation (e.g., "How has my HRV changed this month?"),
So that I can understand long-term patterns and their implications.

### US5: Contextual Data Interpretation

As Executive Alex,
I want to understand what my current metrics mean in context (e.g., "Is an HRV of 42 good for me?"),
So that I can benchmark my performance against my personal baselines.

### 4. Functional Requirements
F1: Synthetic User Data System
F1.1 System must generate realistic WHOOP user data for Executive Alex persona including:

90 days of daily metrics (HRV, RHR, Sleep, Recovery, Strain)
Weekly workout patterns (4x/week schedule with variations)
Realistic correlations between metrics (e.g., high strain days affecting next-day recovery)
Seasonal and lifestyle variations (work stress periods, travel, etc.)

F1.2 Data must include personal baselines and trends:

Individual HRV baseline (e.g., 45-55 range)
Sleep duration patterns (6.5-8 hours with consistency issues)
Recovery patterns showing workout impact

F2: Conversational AI Interface

F2.1 System must provide a chat interface that accepts natural language queries about health data

F2.2 System must integrate with OpenAI API using engineered system prompts that include:

## WHOOP domain expertise
User's personal data context
Behavior change coaching principles
Executive-friendly communication style

F2.3 AI responses must be:

Personalized using specific user data points
Actionable with clear next steps
Educational, explaining the "why" behind recommendations
Concise (under 150 words initially, expandable on request)
F3: Core Query Handling
F3.1 System must handle the three primary question types:

Workout readiness assessment ("Should I work out today?")
Symptom analysis ("Why am I tired today?")
Sleep optimization guidance ("How can I improve my sleep?")
F3.2 System must provide historical trend analysis:

Weekly/monthly pattern recognition
Correlation identification between behaviors and outcomes
Progress tracking over time
F4: Data Contextualization
F4.1 System must interpret current metrics against personal baselines

Compare today's HRV to user's 30-day average
Assess recovery relative to typical post-workout patterns
Evaluate sleep quality against user's consistency goals
F4.2 System must provide progressive disclosure:

Start with simple, actionable guidance
Offer detailed explanations when requested
Surface relevant data points to support recommendations

F5: Technical Implementation
F5.1 Frontend must be responsive and mobile-optimized F5.2 Backend must securely handle OpenAI API integration F5.3 Application must be deployable to production (Vercel/Netlify) F5.4 Code must be organized in a clean, maintainable structure for GitHub portfolio

# Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
Real WHOOP device integration - Using synthetic data only
User authentication/accounts - Single demo user experience
Data persistence - Session-based interactions only
Multi-user support - Focused on single persona
Advanced visualizations - Text-based insights primarily
Mobile app development - Web-based interface only but should be responsive
Payment/subscription features - Demo purposes only

## Technical Considerations
Architecture
Frontend: React/Next.js with TypeScript for type safety
Styling: Tailwind CSS for rapid development
API Integration: OpenAI GPT-4 for conversational responses
Deployment: Vercel for seamless GitHub integration
Data Storage: Static JSON files (no database required for demo)

System Prompt Engineering

Must include:

WHOOP domain knowledge (sleep science, HRV interpretation, recovery metrics)
User context injection (current metrics, historical patterns, goals)
Response formatting guidelines (tone, length, structure)
Behavior change psychology principles
Performance Requirements
API response time: <3 seconds
Mobile compatibility: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
Deployment: Auto-deploy from GitHub main branch

# Success Metrics
## Demo Effectiveness
Conversation Quality: AI provides relevant, personalized responses to all primary query types
Data Integration: Responses reference specific user metrics and demonstrate understanding of context
User Experience: Smooth chat interface with quick response times

## Technical Success
Deployment: Successfully deployed and publicly accessible
Code Quality: Clean, documented codebase suitable for portfolio
API Integration: Stable OpenAI integration with proper error handling

## Learning Objectives
System Prompt Mastery: Effective prompt engineering demonstrated through quality responses
Full-Stack Implementation: Complete application from data generation to production deployment
8. Open Questions
Should we include workout recommendations beyond just yes/no guidance? Yes
How detailed should the sleep analysis be (sleep stages, timing recommendations)? Yes
Should the AI proactively offer insights or only respond to queries? Proactively offer insights

What's the optimal balance between WHOOP-specific terminology and accessibility? Should feel a real Whoop feature
